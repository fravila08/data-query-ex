-- Can you edit the query so that we are only

-- Let’s go even further and sort the instructions 
-- in alphabetical order (A-Z).

-- SELECT special_instructions
-- FROM orders
-- WHERE special_instructions is not NULL
-- ORDER BY special_instructions
-- LIMIT 20;

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

-- Are there any funny or interesting ones? 
-- SELECT special_instructions

-- Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids.

-- For more readability:
-- Rename id as ‘#’
-- Rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’
-- SELECT id AS "#", special_instructions as 'Notes'
-- FROM orders
-- WHERE special_instructions is not NULL
-- ORDER BY id
-- LIMIT 30;
